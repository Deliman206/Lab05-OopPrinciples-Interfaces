# Lab05-OopPrinciples-Interfaces
C# console application to build a zoo with classes and interfaces

An introduction to the project

## Project
- Using all 4 of the Object Oriented Principles (OOPs): - Build out the hierarchical class structure of the animals within a zoo within Visual Studio and a digital diagram. - There should be at least 3 layers of inheritance with at least 5 different types of animals.
  -Prove that the OOP principles are being used by returning strings as necessary to prove that a methods were property implemented or inherited.
- Your digital drawing of your zoo

### OOP Principles


#### Inheritance
This is the concept of passing properties and methods from a base class to a derived class. When a derived class is instantiated if the class has a base class it is inheriting, the derived class will have access to the properties and methods of the base class.

#### Abstraction
This is the concept of concrete and abstract classes. By default classes in C# are concrete and thus can be instantiated with the key word "new". abstract classes cannot be instantiated and must be inherited in order to be instantiated.

#### Polymorphism
This is the concept of passing methods through inheritance. Polymorphism uses abstarction and virtual. This provides context for what a derived class must do to inherit a base class. For example if a method of a base class is labeled as "abstract" then the derived class must "override" the method and define it with in its own scope.

#### Encapsulation
This is the concept of access. Ecapsulation deals with keywords such as "private", "public", & "protected". Each has its own layer of protect while the public access modifier can be accessed by any class.

### Interfaces
Interfaces allow develoers to inherit properties and methods from more than one source, i.e. the base class. A class uses interfaces much like it uses a base class however interfaces must be overriden and its properties and methods can be accessed by any class if either it has a base class with said interfaces or the interfaces are directly iherited to said class.
